Hi! I'm a Python developer having a knack for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I specialize in building smart automation tools, GenAI-powered solutions and interactive web applications, blending technical expertise with creativity.

I've developed real-world projects and built intelligent tools such as:
- AI models for Defect Detection, Image Segmentation, and NER using Transformers (BERT)
- Forecasting models (Energy, Sales) and LLM-powered assistants
- Offline LLM based PDF assistants (with OCR)
- Python desktop apps: GUI tools with SQL databases, CRUD operations, automation, and scraping
- Prompt engineering for GenAI tools
- Genetic Algorithm-based game level designer
- Real-time Blackhole Rendering in OpenGL using CUDA
- Data wrangling + backend scripts

**Tech I work with:**
- Python, Tkinter, Streamlit, Plotly Dash
- Cloud: Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud
- CUDA (C, basic C++), OpenGL
- LLMs: Mistral, GPT4All, LLaMA.cpp via `ctransformers`
- Sentence Transformers, FAISS, OCR (Tesseract)
- OpenCV Models: YOLOv8, Detectron
- Deep Learning: LSTM, ARIMA, SARIMA, PyTorch, TensorFlow
- Rust (beginner), Web scraping, SQL, MongoDB, Git, Bash

I'm also diving deeper into **Generative AI**, **Ethical Hacking**, and **Rust**. Iâ€™m always up for a challenge and ready to bring fresh ideas to the table.
