Hi! I'm a Python developer having a knack for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I specialize in building smart automation tools, GenAI-powered solutions and interactive web applications, blending technical expertise with creativity. 

I've developed real-world projects and built intelligent tools such as:
•	AI models for Defect Detection, Image Segmentation, and NER using Transformers (BERT)
•	Forecasting models (Energy, Sales) and LLM-powered assistants
•	Offline LLM based PDF assistants (with OCR)
•	Python desktop apps GUI tools with SQL databases and CRUD operations, automation and scraping
•	Prompt engineering for GenAI tools
•	Genetic Algorithm based game level designer
•	Real-time Blackhole Rendering in OpenGL using CUDA
•	Data wrangling + backend scripts

Tech I work with:
•	Python, Tkinter, Streamlit, Plotly Dash
•	Cloud Technologies: Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud
•	CUDA using C and basic C++, OpenGL
•	LLMs: Mistral, GPT4All, LLaMA.cpp via ctransformers
•	Sentence Transformers, FAISS, OCR (Tesseract)
•	OpenCV Models: Yolov8, Detectron
•	Deep Learning Models: LSTM, ARIMA, SARIMA , PyTorch, Tensorflow
•	Rust (beginner), Web scraping, SQL, MongoDB, Git, Bash


I'm also diving deeper into Generative AI, Ethical Hacking, and Rust, I am always up for a challenge and ready to bring fresh ideas to the table.
